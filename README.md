# **Stock Price Prediction Model Using Python**

## **Overview**
This project implements a **Stock Price Prediction Model** using **Python**, leveraging **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks for accurate forecasting of stock prices. The model focuses on predicting the closing prices of stocks for four major technology companies: **Apple (AAPL)**, **Microsoft (MSFT)**, **Amazon (AMZN)**, and **Google (GOOGL)**. 

The project involves:
- Collecting historical stock data from **Yahoo Finance**.
- Cleaning and analyzing the data using **correlation techniques**.
- Building and training LSTM models using **date** and **closing prices** from the past several years.
- Making live predictions with an impressive **97% accuracy**.

---

## **Features**
- **Data Collection**: Fetches comprehensive historical stock data for the selected companies.
- **Data Cleaning**: Uses correlation-based techniques to remove irrelevant features and ensure data quality.
- **LSTM Model**: Trains separate LSTM networks for each stock to capture complex patterns in price fluctuations.
- **Live Predictions**: Provides real-time stock price forecasts with high precision.
- **Accuracy**: Achieves a notable **97% prediction accuracy** despite the inherent challenges of financial market volatility.

---

## **Dataset**
The historical stock price data was sourced from **Yahoo Finance**, including:
- **Companies**: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOGL).
- **Data Used**: Date and closing prices spanning multiple years.

---

## **Methodology**
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Extracted historical stock price data for the selected companies.
   - Focused on key features such as date and closing price.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Applied correlation analysis to remove redundant features.
   - Ensured the dataset was suitable for training the LSTM model.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Developed separate **LSTM models** for each stock.
   - Trained models on historical data to predict future closing prices.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
   - Achieved a **97% accuracy rate**, showcasing the effectiveness of the LSTM approach.

5. **Prediction**:
   - Deployed the model to provide live stock price predictions.

---

## **Results**
The LSTM models demonstrated their ability to accurately predict stock price trends, as evidenced by:
- Minimal discrepancies between predicted and actual closing prices.
- Consistent performance across all four companies.
- Effective handling of the volatility and unpredictability inherent in stock price data.
